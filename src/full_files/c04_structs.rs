/// This module shows some KEY concepts of Rust:
///     structs
///     impl

// TODO : add rustdoc links for impl

// A struct is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values
//  that make up a meaningful group.
//  Each piece of data and its name is called a field, different fields can have different types
// See
//      https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html

// We can also use `pub` to designate structs (and enums) as public,
// but there are a few extra details. If we use pub before a struct definition,
// we make the struct public, but the structâ€™s fields will still be private.
// We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case basis.

// NOW: define these structs that are public,
// and then two functions that return instances of these functions outside
// we need these functions because we can't create instances of these structs outside
// since their fields are private
/// a public struct `Square` that can be initialised in other modules, but whose field is inaccessible
pub struct Square {
    side: u32
}
/// a public struct `Rhombus` with a public `side` field and a private angle
pub struct Rhombus {
