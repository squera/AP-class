/// This module shows some KEY concepts of Rust:
///     structs

// TODO : add rustdoc links for impl

// A struct is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values
//  that make up a meaningful group.
//  Each piece of data and its name is called a field, different fields can have different types
// See
//      https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html
